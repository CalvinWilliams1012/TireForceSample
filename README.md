# TireForce sample code
 This repo contains my test code created for TireForce.
 This is a simple test program using basic MVC/CodeIgniter for a simple database php interaction.
 Total time programming was give or take 5 hours.

# Description

## Spec: 
1. Build a sample database with some vehicle and tires info (donâ€™t need the complete data, just some sample date will be enough). 
2. User can search Tire by vehicle 
3. After search, user can get list of tires with brand, model, description, and price. 
4. Make this sample by using CodeIgniter (PHP) as backend, and MySQL as database. 

## Evaluation Key Points: 
1. The MVC design for backend server (CodeIgniter) 
2. Database design and manipulation. 
3. Front-end Web UI is not the key, but it will be extra value add if you provide clean and nice look-n-feel.
